# "Be nice", spelled out
 
* Absolutely no harassment or hate speech of any kind will be tolerated for developing, contributing without being a developer, or even interacting from the (one day) user community.

# "Stay on topic for the most part", spelled out

* This is about TypeScript app development of Fyne.io applications. Try to find a way back from any related side conversations at some point.

# "Be rounded", spelled out

* Demonstrate adeptness with "I could be wrong, but... " if you're debating a thing.
* Know that dispassionately criticizing a thing is generally acceptable, but criticizing a person is not: "Could we have Jest tests with that?" vs "You should have written tests, try again" (and more strongly worded).
* Assume good intentions - people contribute in different ways and at different skill levels.
* Value learning over being right - we're all here to improve (refer "I could be wrong, but...")

# "Contribute constructively", spelled out

* Pull requests welcome! Please include tests when adding features or fixing bugs. AI use to help you make good terse/elegant tests is just fine.
* Issues should be filed if your google, stackoverflow (etc) research has not yielded an answer. Please say what you searched for that didn't solve your problem. Please also consider posing the same problem to AI toward solution, and saying so in the bug report.
* Issues should be clear and actionable - include reproduction steps for bugs. Don't be upset if you're asked to make a failing test in a PR. 
* Documentation improvements are just as valuable as code.
* Ask questions! There are no stupid questions, only opportunities to improve our docs.

# "Respect the architecture", spelled out

* This project explores pseudo-declarative MVC patterns inspired by many prior technologies.
* Understand the goals before proposing major architectural changes.  That said we are open to "Tsyne could also have..." modes that don't take out existing modes.
* If you want to take the project in a different direction, consider forking - no hard feelings!

# Enforcement

* Maintainers will address violations with a warning first. We will try to do this privately first, and will keep notes.
* Repeated violations or severe harassment will result in being exclusion from the project. That might happen quicker for anon participants than those who are not.
* Decisions are final but can be appealed by contacting project maintainers directly. We will keep notes, and ask the same code of conduct applies in 1:1 conversations.

# Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from various community standards and tailored to fit this project's collaborative, educational spirit.
